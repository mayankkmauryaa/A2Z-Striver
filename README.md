# 🚀 Striver's A2Z DSA Course — by **Mayank Maurya**

Hey! This repository is where I document my entire journey through the **Striver A2Z DSA Sheet**.  
I created this repo to keep all my solutions well-organized, track my progress, and hopefully help anyone else following the same roadmap.

## 🎯 Why I Made This Repo

I’m using this space to:

- Track my **DSA learning progress** step by step  
- Store all my **A2Z Sheet solutions** in one clean and structured place  
- Make it easier for others to refer to these problems and learn along with me  

If you're also going through Striver’s A2Z course, feel free to use this repo as a reference!
